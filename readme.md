# Pest Control

A personal project that I'm undertaking for the sole purpose of properly learning unit and integration testing with Pytest and Django.

But Why?

> 1. I'm done with spending countless hours trying to track down the source of a bug;
> 2. I think my code will ultimately be cleaner and more robust with a test-first approach.
